Small program that uses exposed API's for video game Devil Daggers

Uses the API to return a given 100 players from a start point to loop over calls and
print the entire leaderboard

Written in node.js, somewhat of a reinvinted Riot API Leaderboard Bot project but with much
more cooperative API's

Run the main.js file to begin printing the current leaderboard

WIP: Optimization to get synchronous calls and avoid awaits, implement AWS logging through Cloudwatch
